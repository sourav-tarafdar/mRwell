mRwell geometry macro files from ATHENA . The layers are at 79.5 and 90 cm from the beamline. But can be changed from the macro "G4_RWell.C".  
Geometry file with support structure for mRwell -> Build_G4_RWell_Sup01.C
Geometry file with  out support structure for mRwell -> Build_G4_RWell_Bare.C
Initialization + selecting radial location of the layers -> G4_RWell.C
